  <p>For my Computer Aided Graphics class in 2020, I was given an assignment to redesign a company's logo. For this Assignment, I chose to redesign Amazon's logo. I kept the smile while adding a tropical tree to have an "amazon" theme, and included an a and z to symbolize that Amazon will deliver to people of different names, including those that start with A to those that start with Z.</p>
  <p>For my Computer Aided Graphics class in 2020, I was given an assignment to create a business card for any fictional character, and I chose the infamous and hilarious Dwight Schrute from "The Office." I had to include the "Assistant Regional Manager" title with "to the" in parentheses because of Dwight always saying he has the "Assigtant Regional Manager" title when in actuality he has the "Assitant to the Regional Manager" title. </p>
  <p>For my Composing Digital Media class in 2022, I was given an assignment to create a visual argument for anything. </p>
