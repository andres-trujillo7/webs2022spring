I've wanted to this for a long time, but have never had the skillset or knowledge of how to do it. That is, making a portfolio for every project (that has significant meaning to me) I've made.

The main reason I want to do this, is to have a place all my meaningful projects can call home, with this home being a very "nice-looking" home. These projects include my coding projects, Photoshop/photo-editing projects, and either audio-projects, or just a general "OTHER" kind of projects. I'm still deciding on that one.

The second reason why I'd want to do this is for future potential employers to check out. I want them to know what I'm capable of!

Please check out the websiteIdeaSketch.PNG file to see what I want my portfolio to look like.

After seeing that, you can see I plan on having separate pages for my projects, and one other section that I'm still deciding on. Right now I'm in between it being a resume or contact section. TBD. On the home page, I plan on having a short biography about myself along with a picture of me because I want this portfolio to represent me!
