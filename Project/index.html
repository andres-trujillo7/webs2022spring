    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am currently a Sophomore pursuing a major in Computer Science and minor in Spanish at the University of Pittsburgh.
      <br>I want to apply what I learn at school to solve real-world problems and make the world better in any way I can.
      <br> My dream is for all STEM-related fields to have a level playing field by embracing equal representation of all different kinds of groups.
      <br> My goal is to make that dream a reality.</p>
