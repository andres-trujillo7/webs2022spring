    The Winter Walk</h3>

  <p class = "wintertext"> <br>For my Composing Digital Media class in 2022, I was given an assignment to create an audio narrative. Here is a general idea of what it is about:  <br><br>
    The college student is a generally stressed kid. He usually is overloaded with work, and never seems to have free time. In the event that he does manage to find some free time, he enjoys going on walks. He loves walking in the outdoors, rain or shine, hot or cold, night or day. He loves walking because it relieves his stress. Walking is therapeutic to him because it allows him to become one with nature and to not have a care in the world but admiring the beautiful earth. At college, the student's go-to walking location is a nearby park with a large soccer field, some playgrounds, and a long trail. Whenever he has no schoolwork, that is where is goes.
<br><br>
It is now a cold and early Saturday morning in December and the student has just woken up. Last night, he just finished a big programming assignment. He also finished all the other homework he had from his other classes before he went to bad last night, sacrificing a night out with friends. However, that does not matter as he now has as much free time as he desires. So, the first thing he decides to do with that free time is go on a walk...</p>

<p class = "music" align = "center">When I listen to music, I always appreciate the production of songs. With that, I wanted to try out making beats of my own.</p><br><br>
<div class = "audiobox">
  <h4 class = "destiny"> Destiny </h4>
  <p>
    "Destiny" is a mixtape of beats I made back in 2016 when I was 14 years old. The reason I gave the mixtape this name is because I was in love with the sci-fi video game "Destiny" at the time, and thought that these beats had a "space-y" feel. </p> <br><br>

<br><br>
<p> "Soccar" is a beat I finished making in 2022. "Soccar" has this name because as I was working on it, I thought it sounded like it would fit right into the soundtrack of the hit game "Rocket League." </p>

<h4 class = "room"> Chilling in my room Pack </h4>
<p>The "Chilling in my room Pack" is a collection of two beats I finished making in 2022: "Solitude" and "Solitude 2." "Solitude 2" has its name because "Solitude" transitions into "Solitude 2." </p> <br><br>
