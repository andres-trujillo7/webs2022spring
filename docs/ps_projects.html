  <h3> Conf√≠a en El Proceso</h3> <br>
  <img src='Confia_en_El_Proceso.png' width='750' alt='El Proceso Visual Argument'>
  <p class = "confiaText">For my Composing Digital Media class in 2022, I was given an assignment to create a visual argument. <br><br>
    For my visual argument, I want to make something that holds a lot of meaning to me. I want my argument to portray my optimism and how likely I think it is for El Salvador's national (football/soccer) team (aka La Selecta) to qualify to the 2026 World Cup. They haven't done it since 1982, and have been struggling to do it since due to certain scandals such as match-fixing, poor infrastructure etc. Nevertheless, fortunately, lately, things have been looking up. Just about a year ago, they had a horrible coach who often made questionable decisions, and the players weren't performing, so all hope had seem lost and it seemed like I would never be able to see El Salvador play in the World Cup. <br><br>

  Luckily, that coach left, and a new coach, Hugo Perez, came in (Mid-2021) and started a process. A process that involves developing players while they're young, calling up new players, and making the players work harder. This process has been paying off so far as seen with our team's recent performances. However, while we have gotten better, the end goal is still qualifying to the World cup, and the process, while going well, is still a process, and that goal is still being worked towards. My stance on this is that I trust in this process and believe that we can and will qualify for the 2026 World Cup, giving us a real shot at winning the most coveted trophy of them all </p>

  <h3> Dwight Schrute Business Card</h3> <br>
  <img src='Business_Card.jpg' width='750' alt='Dwight Schrute Business Card'><br><br>
  <p>For my Computer Aided Graphics class in 2020, I was given an assignment to create a business card for any fictional character, and I chose the infamous and hilarious Dwight Schrute from "The Office." I had to include the "Assistant Regional Manager" title with "to the" in parentheses because of Dwight always saying he has the "Assigtant Regional Manager" title when in actuality he has the "Assitant to the Regional Manager" title. </p>

    <h3> Amazon Logo Redesign</h3> <br>
  <img src='Amazon_Logo.jpg' width='750' alt='Amazon logo redesign'><br><br>
  <p>For my Computer Aided Graphics class in 2020, I was given an assignment to redesign a company's logo. For this Assignment, I chose to redesign Amazon's logo. I kept the smile while adding a tropical tree to have an "amazon" theme, and included an a and z because Amazon has an "a" and "z" in the word and to symbolize that Amazon will deliver to people of different names, including those that start with A to those that start with Z.</p>
